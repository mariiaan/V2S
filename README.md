# V2S
Convert videos to braille subtitles
Tutorial available on my Youtube channel samplefx.

The programs code is not well optimised or clean. It just works.
There are builds for windows available. You have to build it yourself for other platforms.
This program is licensed under the MIT license.
This program includes ffmpeg (used for video decoding) which is licensed under GPL 2.1

# Compilation
Create a new .NET framework app (for example with Visual Studio 2019 Community) and replace the "Program.cs" file with the "Program.cs" file on this branch.

# Issues
Poorly, fast written code. Do not take this as a reference to well-written code.
